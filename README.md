# TechShorts - Web based Inshorts

TechShorts is a web application inspired by the popular mobile news app, Inshorts, but designed specifically for laptops and computers. It fetches live news from a free news API, ensuring you stay updated with the latest headlines right from your desktop.

Built using React, TechShorts features a simple design reminiscent of the Inshorts mobile app, providing a seamless user experience across devices. You can navigate through news articles using the up and down arrow keys, making it even easier to stay informed while on your computer.
