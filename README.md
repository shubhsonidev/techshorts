# TechShorts - Web based Inshorts

TechShorts is a web application inspired by the popular mobile news app, Inshorts, but designed specifically for laptops and computers. It fetches live news from a free news API, ensuring you stay updated with the latest headlines right from your desktop.

Built using React, TechShorts features a simple design reminiscent of the Inshorts mobile app, providing a seamless user experience across devices. You can navigate through news articles using the up and down arrow keys, making it even easier to stay informed while on your computer.

As an avid user of Inshorts, I noticed the absence of a web app version for laptops and computers. So, I took it upon myself to fill that gap and create TechShorts.
